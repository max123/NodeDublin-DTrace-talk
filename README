This contains the slides for my talk at NodeDublin, October 18 and 19 2012.
The directory also contains some D scripts and some node.js clients and servers
that I use during the talk.  The echofile-server1.js script is used most
frequently, and is the most complete of the scripts.

To run this, you'll need a system with DTrace.  Instructions for everything else
are in the pdf slides.

The usual disclaimers... I have no idea of robustness of this code.  Nor do I claim to
be a node.js expert.  Any improvements/comments/suggestions are appreciated.
